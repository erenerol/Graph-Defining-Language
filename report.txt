A report describing the challenges you have faced and how you addressed them:

While we were doing this part of the project, we encounter some challanges, some of which are:
1- making a connection between lex and yacc: it was difficult to manage 
2- Since there are many rules in grammers, we encounter many errors (shift/reduce conflict, segmentation fault...) which are produced by yacc, while we were using commends.
Altough it was not difficult to solve errors and bug, it takes more times because of the unknown location of the errors and bugs. 
3-In addition to this, useless properties are not produce any errors, so it was not so important,however, we tried to deal with it.
Additionally, we encounter some warnings(not errors, it only suggest what can be done instead of the code in the file),
while we are using make commend, and we taken into consideration those warnings.
4- Since our BNF grammer have symbols, such as '*', '+', '?'.., it creates a problem in yacc file. So we had to solve this problem by seperating it more rules.
